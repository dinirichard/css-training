  <h1>Understanding css Positioning</h1>
  <p><em>Static Positioning</em>
   is the default behaviour of elements.
   <em> Inherited positioning</em> tells an element to inherit its positioning from its parent element.
   <em> Z-index</em> controls the vertical stacking order of elements. Elements must have a set positioning for z-index to work.
